        Everyday digital interfaces include a rich variety of images,
        visualizations, and other pictures. However, more than anything else,
        they are made of words. Oh so many words. As we equip teams to design
        and code usable, consistent, beautiful interfaces using systems, it’s
        essential that words depend on a strong foundation of typography.

        I’ll admit, I am not a typography expert. I lack a graphic design
        degree. I’m never the person choosing a font, scaling type, or finessing
        letter spacing. As a result, I’ve always been reluctant to write about
        typography.

        On the other hand, I am a pattern hunter. Over the years, I’ve
        contributed to many design systems that set a foundation for typography.
        Each traversed of steps and decisions to set a foundation and apply it
        to an emerging library of interface components. This article summarizes
        those patterns.

        Typography starts by setting a foundation of font families and weights
        along with fallbacks. It then explores how to build hierarchy using
        size, color, additional details like line-height, and layering
        responsiveness. Those models are then applied to components in a
        system’s library (like Article and Header) as well as custom components
        made by other teams.
